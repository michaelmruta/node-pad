# Node-PAD

Node-PAD is Node-RED for iPad.

![Alt text](preview.png?raw=true "Preview")

A programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.


It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its runtime in a single-tap.

Notice: This is not compatible with many nodes in the official repository due to ios security restrictions and device limitations.


Pre-installed nodes:

dashboard, ui-table ui-list ui-vega ui-lineargauge ui-value-trail ui-heatmap ui-media ui-led ui-level ui-state-trail ui-statechart ui-svg ui-contextmenu ui-week-schedule dashboard-bar-chart-data, alexa, email

## About this fork

This branch will be the official copy of what will be published on the app store. It is expected that there will be a lag from every official release of the original project.
